A standalone service designed to consolidate your graphql APIs into one endpoint.

For a more detailed description of this project's
motivation read [this post](). For a guide to getting started read [this post]()

## Running the Executable Directly

The simplest way to run a gateway is to download the executable
from the latest release on GitHub and then run it directly on
your machine:

```bash
$ ./graphql-gateway start --port 4000 --services http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001
```

This will start a server on port 4000 that wraps over the services
running at `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3001`. For more information on possible
arguments to pass the executable, run `./graphql-gateway --help`.

## Customizing the Gateway

While the executable is good for getting started quickly, it isn't sufficient for
most production usecases. Unfortunately, there is currently no story to plug in custom
authentication/authorization logic or other extensions when running a gateway with the
cli. If being able to run a custom gateway with the cli is something that interests you,
please open in an issue! For now, these common situations require building your own executable.

The core object of the gateway is the `gateway.Gateway` struct exported by the module at
`github.com/alecaivazis/graphql-gateway`. A `gateway.Gateway` is constructed by providing
a list of `graphql.RemoteSchema`s for each service to `gateway.New`. The easiest way to
get a `graphql.RemoteSchema` is to introspect the remote schema using a utility from
`github.com/alecaivazis/graphql-gateway/graphql`:

```golang
package main

import (
	gateway "github.com/alecaivazis/graphql-gateway"
	"github.com/alecaivazis/graphql-gateway/graphql"
)

func main() {
	// introspect the apis
	schemas, err := graphql.IntrospectRemoteSchemas(
		"http://localhost:3000",
		"http://localhost:3001",
    	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// create the gateway instance
	gateway, err := gateway.New(schemas)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

A `Gateway` provides 2 different handlers that can plug into whatever web server you prefer:

- `gateway.GraphQLHandler` responds to both `GET` and `POST` requests as described
  [in the spec](https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/).
- `gateway.PlaygroundHandler` responds to `GET` requests with a web-based IDE for easy exploration
  and interprets `POST`s as queries to process.

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	// ... including the ones above
)

func main() {
	// ... including up above

	// add the playground endpoint to the router
	http.HandleFunc("/graphql", gateway.PlaygroundHandler)

	// start the server
	fmt.Println("Starting server")
	err = http.ListenAndServe(":3001", nil)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err.Error())
	}
}
```

### Authentication and Authorization

Currently the gateway has no opinion on a method for authentication and authorization.
Descisions for wether a user can or cannot do something is pushed down to the services
handling the queries. To pass information about the current request to the backing
services, information can be attach to the request context and then used when executing
a query.

See the [auth example](./examples/auth) for more information.

### Customizing Internal Algorithms

The `Gateway` is made up of 3 interface-driven algorithm:

- the `Merger` is responsible for taking a list of `graphql.RemoteSchema` and merging them into
  a single schema. Along the way, it keeps track of what fields are defined at what locations so
  that the `Planner` can do its job.

- the `Planner`s job is to take an incoming query and construct a query plan that will resolve
  the requested query. These query plans have a `Queryer` embedded in them for more flexibility.
  Any kind of query-time changes have to be made to the executor since planning happens once for
  a given query.

- the `Executor` then takes the query plan and executes the query with the provided variables
  and context representing the current user.

At the moment, `graphql-gateway` only provides a single implementation of `Merger`, `Planner`, and
`Executor`. If you have a custom implementation, you can configure the gateway to use them at
construction time:

```golang
gateway.New(schemas, gateway.WithPlanner(MyCustomPlanner{}), gateway.WithExecutor(MyCustomExecutor{}))
```
