# Examples

This directory contains examples of different things one can do with a
custom gateway to fit their needs.

Each example contains a gateway and one or more services that showcase the
example. Please keep in mind that the non-gateway services do not have to be
written in go. All of these examples work regardless of the language you chose
to write your APIs.
